Simplify scenario building network for CBA analysis.

Creates the base CBA network with:
- Fixed optimal capacities from scenario building
- Hurdle costs on DC links
- Extended primary fuel source capacities
- Merge low and high voltage buses

**Inputs**

- Solved network from scenario building workflow

**Outputs**

- `resources/cba/networks/simple_{planning_horizons}.nc`: Simplified network for CBA

    """
    Set infinite capacity for primary fuel source generators.

    Rolling horizon with fixed capacities can artificially limit peak fuel production.
    Primary fuel sources have no capital costs, so unlimited capacity ensures
    sufficient supply without affecting the objective function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : pypsa.Network
        Network to modify.
    tyndp_conventional_carriers : list
        List of conventional carrier names from TYNDP data, which may include
        fuel sub-types (e.g., 'oil-light', 'oil-heavy'). These are grouped by
        their base fuel type (e.g., 'oil').

    Returns
    -------
    None

    Reassign all components attached to buses of `from_carrier` onto their
    corresponding buses (as given by `busmap`), remove the now-empty
    `from_carrier` buses, and drop any lines/links that end up with
    bus0 == bus1 as a result.

    Also drops redundant load-shedding generators sitting on `from_carrier`
    buses, since after reassignment they would duplicate the load-shedding
    generator already present at the target bus.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : pypsa.Network
        Network to modify in place.
    from_carrier : str, default "low voltage"
        Bus carrier to remove (e.g. "low voltage").
    busmap : pandas.Series, optional
        Mapping of `from_carrier` bus name -> target bus name onto which its
        components should be reassigned. Defaults to `None`, in which case
        each bus is mapped onto the bus matching its `location` field, i.e.
        `n.buses.loc[n.buses.carrier == from_carrier, "location"]` is used.
