Simplify scenario building network for CBA analysis.

Creates the base CBA network with:
- Fixed optimal capacities from scenario building
- Hurdle costs on DC links
- Extended primary fuel source capacities

**Inputs**

- Solved network from scenario building workflow

**Outputs**

- `resources/cba/networks/simple_{planning_horizons}.nc`: Simplified network for CBA

    Set infinite capacity for primary fuel source generators.

    Rolling horizon with fixed capacities can artificially limit peak fuel production.
    Primary fuel sources have no capital costs, so unlimited capacity ensures
    sufficient supply without affecting the objective function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : pypsa.Network
        Network to modify.
    tyndp_conventional_carriers : list
        List of conventional carrier names from TYNDP data, which may include

        their base fuel type (e.g., 'oil').

    Returns
    -------
    None
        Network is modified in place.
