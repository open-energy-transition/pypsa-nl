Retrieving Data
###############

Not all data dependencies are shipped with the git repository, since git is not suited for handling large changing files.
Instead we use separate steps in the workflow (``rules`` executed by ``snakemake``) to download external data using the ``retrieve_<dataset>`` rules.

Data is generally retrieved in a version-controlled manner, enabling control over input data versions, reproducibility and consistency of modelling runs.
The rules download data into subfolders in the `data/` directory, following the structure
``data/{dataset}/{source}/{version}``, e.g. ``data/jrc_idees/primary/March-2025-V1/``.
Which specific data version is retrieved can be controlled in the :ref:`data configuration <data_cf>`.

For Open-TYNDP runs, most datasets can also be retrieved from a dedicated Google Cloud Storage
bucket instead of their original sources. See :ref:`tyndp_archive` in the SB documentation.

Below some specific ``retrieve_<dataset>`` rules are documented.
For more information on the datasets retrieved, see the `data sources <https://pypsa-eur.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_sources.html>`__ and *Data inventory* section there in the documentation.


Rule ``retrieve_bidding_zones``
=========================================

.. automodule:: retrieve_bidding_zones

Rule ``retrieve_cutout``
============================

See :ref:`cutouts`.



Rule ``retrieve_electricity_demand_opsd``
=========================================

This rule downloads hourly electric load data for each country from the `OPSD platform <https://data.open-power-system-data.org/time_series/2019-06-05/time_series_60min_singleindex.csv>`__.

**Relevant Settings**

None.

**Outputs**

- ``data/electricity_demand_opsd_raw.csv``

Rule ``retrieve_electricity_demand_entsoe``
===========================================

This rule downloads hourly electric load data for each country from the `ENTSOE Transparency Platform <https://transparency.entsoe.eu>`__.

**Relevant Settings**

None.

**Outputs**

- ``data/electricity_demand_entsoe_raw.csv``

Rule ``retrieve_electricity_demand_neso``
=========================================

This rule downloads hourly electric load data for the United Kingdom from the `NESO Data Portal <https://www.neso.energy/data-portal/historic-demand-data>`__.

**Relevant Settings**

None.

**Outputs**

- ``data/electricity_demand_neso_raw.csv``

Rule ``retrieve_cost_data``
================================

This rule downloads techno-economic assumptions from the `technology-data repository <https://github.com/pypsa/technology-data>`__.

**Relevant Settings**

.. code:: yaml

    costs:
        year:

.. seealso::
    Documentation of the configuration file ``config/config.yaml`` at
    :ref:`costs_cf`

**Outputs**

- ``data/costs/primary/{version}/costs_{year}.csv``


Rule ``retrieve_countries_centroids``
====================================

This rule downloads country centroid geometry data by `Copyright (c) 2021 Gavin Rehkemper` from https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/gavinr/world-countries-centroids@v1.0.0/dist/countries.geojson.

**Relevant Settings**

None.

**Outputs**

- ``data/countries_centroids.geojson``


Rule ``retrieve_presolved_networks``
====================================

This rule downloads pre-solved networks from a previous Open-TYNDP release (*preliminary outcomes* published on `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org/records/18608105>`__) and extracts the solved network for each planning horizon. These can be investigated with PyPSA-Explorer's web interface using the ``launch_presolved_explorer`` rule without having to re-run the workflow.

**Relevant Settings**

.. code:: yaml

    data:
        open_tyndp_prelim:
            source:
            version:

**Outputs**

- ``data/open_tyndp_prelim/{source}/{version}/base_s_all___{planning_horizons}.nc``
